# Project Progress Report

## Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure and Data Management
### Completed âœ“
1. Development Environment Setup
   - âœ“ Python environment with virtual env
   - âœ“ Git repository created and configured
   - âœ“ Key libraries installed (openai, tweepy)
   - âœ“ Security measures implemented (.gitignore, .env)

2. Data Source Integration
   - âœ“ Access to presets.json from BeyondHorizonCalc
   - âœ“ Location data parsing and management
   - âœ“ Refraction level formatting (matching web app)

### Blocked ðŸš«
1. Tweet Content Generation
   - ðŸš« Need calculated results for meaningful tweets:
     * Distance to Horizon
     * Horizon Dip Angle
     * Hidden Height
     * Visible Height
   - ðŸš« Decision needed: Create static results for presets vs. Azure Functions API

### Next Steps ðŸ“‹
1. Results Data Integration
   - Create extended presets data including pre-calculated results
   - Design data structure for combined preset + calculation data
   - Update tweet formatting to include calculation results

2. Azure Functions Integration Planning
   - Define API endpoint structure
   - Plan authentication method
   - Design fallback mechanism for API unavailability

## Future Phases (Pending Phase 1 Completion)
### Phase 2: Enhanced Content
- Visual content integration (maps, location images)
- Elevation profile visualization
- Weather condition integration

### Phase 3: Automation
- Scheduling system implementation
- Post frequency optimization
- Error handling and recovery

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Analytics
- Tweet performance tracking
- Engagement analytics
- Content optimization based on performance

## Current Priorities
1. **Immediate Focus**:
   - Define structure for pre-calculated results
   - Update location manager to include calculation data
   - Revise tweet content format

2. **Technical Decisions Needed**:
   - Storage format for calculation results
   - Integration method with Azure Functions API
   - Backup data strategy

## Issues and Challenges
- Need calculated results for meaningful tweet content
- Decision required on handling preset calculations
- API integration complexity for non-preset calculations
